# Virtual Venture

This project was built for the Hello World 2022 hackathon.

Virtual Venture is a website designed to offer assistance for businesses attempting to go digital for the first time, or for users who are not particularly tech savvy. It offers random brand name creation, and many articles that explain topics that people may need to know about. Any technichal words have definitions to increase understandability.

This website was hosted using AWS Amplify.
